# Salon de Coiffure - Syst√®me de R√©servation

## Overview
This is a professional hair salon booking management system built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with Three.js 3D background animations. The application uses localStorage for data persistence (client-side only) and provides:
- Public booking interface with modern UI
- Client list view with "in progress" status
- Announcements page for salon updates
- Admin panel for managing bookings, announcements, and settings
- Interactive 3D particle background using Three.js

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application with Three.js
- **No Backend**: All data stored in browser's localStorage
- **Pages**:
  - `index.html` - Redirects to announcements page
  - `annoncent.html` - Public announcements page
  - `reservation.html` - Booking form for clients
  - `list.html` - Public list of all bookings grouped by day
  - `contact.html` - Contact page with salon info and social media links
  - `admin.html` - Admin panel (requires login)
- **Assets**:
  - `css/style.css` - Enhanced professional gold on black theme with modern effects
  - `js/main.js` - All application logic
  - `js/background3d.js` - Three.js 3D particle background animation
  - `logo.png` - Salon logo

## Features
### Client Features
- Book appointments (name, surname, phone optional)
- View all bookings organized by day
- See which client is currently being served ("En cours")
- View salon announcements and system notifications
- Contact page with phone, email, address, and social media links
- Fully bilingual interface (French/Arabic) with RTL support

### Admin Features (Login: younes/younes)
- Manage bookings: promote in queue, edit, delete, mark "in progress"
- Cancel entire days (automatically reschedules clients)
- Restore cancelled days
- Create public announcements
- Change admin credentials
- View activity journal
- Reset all data

### Business Logic
- Working days: Sunday (0), Tuesday (2), Thursday (4), Friday (5)
- Capacity: Friday = 3 clients, Other days (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday) = 5 clients
- Automatic scheduling to next available day
- Day cancellation with automatic rescheduling
- **Cascade auto-advance on delete**: When admin deletes a booking, entire queue advances - everyone moves one day earlier across all future days
- **Completed bookings**: When client pays/marked as debt (haircut done), booking is marked as completed:
  - Stays in system but hidden from public/admin view
  - Still counts toward day's capacity (keeps spot occupied)
  - Prevents new bookings from filling the spot

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for animated particle background
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Server**: Python 3.11 HTTP server with cache-control headers
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with:
  - Gradient animations
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects
  - Backdrop blur effects
  - Responsive design
  - Professional gold-on-black theme

## Visual Enhancements (Latest Update)
- **3D Background**: Interactive particle system with 3000+ golden particles
  - Follows mouse movement for parallax effect
  - Smooth rotation animation
  - WebGL-based rendering with graceful fallback
  - Optimized performance with additive blending
  
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:

## Development Setup
The project runs on a Python HTTP server (port 5000) with:
