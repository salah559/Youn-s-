# Salon de Coiffure - Syst√®me de R√©servation

## Overview
This is a professional hair salon booking management system built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with Three.js 3D background animations. The application uses localStorage for data persistence (client-side only) and provides:
- Public booking interface with modern UI
- Client list view with "in progress" status
- Announcements page for salon updates
- Admin panel for managing bookings, announcements, and settings
- Interactive 3D particle background using Three.js

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application with Three.js
- **No Backend**: All data stored in browser's localStorage
- **Pages**:
  - `index.html` - Redirects to announcements page
  - `annoncent.html` - Public announcements page
  - `reservation.html` - Booking form for clients
  - `list.html` - Public list of all bookings grouped by day
  - `admin.html` - Admin panel (requires login)
- **Assets**:
  - `css/style.css` - Enhanced professional gold on black theme with modern effects
  - `js/main.js` - All application logic
  - `js/background3d.js` - Three.js 3D particle background animation
  - `logo.png` - Salon logo

## Features
